          I'm a <span id='boldT'>UX/UI Designer</span> and <span id='boldT'>front-end engineer</span> focused in react framework. <br/>
          I have 2 years of experience as web & graphic design freelancer. <br/>
          From the beginning of 2022, I started to learn javascript (reactjs) in order to find a job in front-end development. I didn't started learning from zero, since I have a computer science degree, so it helped me a lot.
